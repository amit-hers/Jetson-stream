# Camera Server Status

## Current Status

The camera server (`enhanced_camera_server_simple.cpp`) has the following status:

### ‚úÖ What Works:
1. Camera initialization with Argus API
2. Frame capture loop starts successfully  
3. Named pipes created and client-server communication works
4. Client successfully receives frames
5. Frame metadata (number, size, timestamp) is sent

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation:
- **YUV pixel data extraction from DMA buffers is not implemented**
- Frames currently have empty/zero YUV data (all black)
- Real pixel extraction requires proper DMA buffer handling

### üéØ Solution: Use main.cpp

Instead of trying to extract YUV in `enhanced_camera_server_simple.cpp`, 
use the **working** `main.cpp` which already captures real frames:

```bash
# This works perfectly for real camera capture:
cd build
./csi_camera_h264_encode -i 0 -r 1280x720 -f 30 -H

# Or for raw frame testing:
./csi_camera_h264_encode -i 0 -r 1280x720 -f 30 -H -w
```

### üìù Alternative: Add Raw Frame Export to main.cpp

To get real camera frames to pipes, modify `main.cpp` to write raw frames to 
named pipes instead of (or in addition to) encoding to H.264.

The proper DMA buffer handling is already working in `main.cpp` - you just 
need to add pipe writing to the ConsumerThread callback.
